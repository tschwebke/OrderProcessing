Microsoft DIV DEV changed the way they do assemblies substantially, and this appears to be the case for all future versions as well.
AT TIME OF WRITING, The only reliable ones for the current version 2015.3, are to take them from the following location:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\TeamFoundation\Team Explorer

Don't use NUGET -> you'll lose your mind.


NOTES:
- Not every assembly (for each function) is present. Add the other assemblies as needed.
